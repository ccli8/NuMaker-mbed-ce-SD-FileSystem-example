# Example for SD card backed file system

This example is cloned from the [FAT file system example](https://github.com/armmbed/mbed-os-example-fat-filesystem) released by ARM mbed team and
is modified to use the [SD block device](https://github.com/OpenNuvoton/NuMaker-mbed-SD-driver)
running in SD bus mode rather than SPI bus mode to back the file system.
